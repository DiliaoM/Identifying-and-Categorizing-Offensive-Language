# Identifying-and-Categorizing-Offensive-Language
 Code for second task
This task is one of tasks in OffensEval 2019. [https://sites.google.com/site/offensevalsharedtask/offenseval2019]

I have done the subtask-B: Automatic categorization of offense types.

After doing the task A, we have known that if a tweet is offensive or not. To know more about the offensive tweets, we are curious about who they are targeting. So in this sub-task, we focus on categorizing offenses. Tweets are labeled from one of the following categories:

- Targeted Insult and Threats(TIN): This is a post which contains an insult or threat to an individual, a group or others.
- Untargeted(UNT): A post without targeted profanity and swearing.

What is mentionable is that posts containing general profanity are not targeted, but they contain non-acceptable language.
